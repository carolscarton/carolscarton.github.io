I am an Academic Fellow at the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. I am a member of the Natural Language Processing group and part of the GATE team. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate for the WeVerify (from March 2019 to August 2019) and SIMPATICO (from July 2016 to February 2019) projects.

In 2017, I was awarded a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield with the thesis entitled "Document-level Machine Translation Quality Estimation". My PhD was funded by the EXPERT project (a Marie Curie ITN network) and my supervisor was Professor Lucia Specia.

I also have a master's degree from the University of São Paulo, Brazil (awarded in 2013). My supervisor was Dr. Sandra Aluísio and I was a member of the Interinstitutional Center for Computational Linguistics (NILC).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing researches, more specifically:

    Personalised NLP
    Text simplification
    Online content verification (misinformation detection)
    Quality estimation of machine translation
    Document-level evaluation of NLP tasks outputs
    Readability assessment
    Automatic construction of computational lexical resources 

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
