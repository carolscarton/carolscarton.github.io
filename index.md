I am an Academic Fellow at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs), University of Sheffield, UK. I am a member of the [Natural Language Processing group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/nlp) and part of the [GATE team](https://gate.ac.uk/). Previously, I worked as a Research Associate for the [WeVerify](https://weverify.eu/) (from March 2019 to August 2019) and [SIMPATICO](https://www.simpatico-project.eu/) (from July 2016 to February 2019) projects.

In 2017, I was awarded a PhD degree in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield with the thesis entitled "Document-level Machine Translation Quality Estimation". My PhD was funded by the [EXPERT](http://expert-itn.eu/) project (a Marie Curie ITN network) and my supervisor was Professor Lucia Specia.

I also have a master's degree from the University of São Paulo, Brazil (awarded in 2013). My supervisor was Dr. Sandra Aluísio and I was a member of the [Interinstitutional Center for Computational Linguistics (NILC)](http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/index.php).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing topics, more specifically:

    Personalised NLP
    Text simplification
    Online content verification (misinformation detection)
    Quality estimation of machine translation
    Document-level evaluation of NLP tasks outputs
    Readability assessment
    Automatic construction of computational lexical resources
